        <p>Hi, my name is Dong Huynh and I have been enjoying this bootcamp so far.
            I have learned lots about Github and using Bootstrap on to make websites.
            I like playing chess and coding in my free time. I am an incoming college freshman
            and I hope to have a wonderful time in college.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was born and raised in Florida my entire life, however I have done some traveling before.
            Learning new things is my passion because I get to know about stuff that I've never seen
            before and sometimes even get excited. An example would be knowing about stocks and bitcoin,
            it was so fun to learn about them because they had a large impact on many people and 
            makes people richer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope this section of the website describes a lot about me. I look forward to making new friends.
